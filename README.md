👋 Hi there, I’m Robbert Aruleba!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Decentralized File Vault — a Web3 dApp for secure document storage, AI-powered job matching, and smart CV building.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), LangChain, and decentralized identity systems (DIDs).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Web3 education tools, AI-integrated dApps, and decentralized career platforms.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with optimizing storage deals, cross-chain content verification, and scaling smart contract systems.
- 💬 Ask me about Solidity, Filecoin, AI x Web3 integration, Hackathon strategy, or how to blend education with blockchain!
- 📫 How to reach me: @robertocarlous on GitHub | LinkedIn
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once built a Web3 voting platform, an LMS, and a staking game — all within hackathon weekends 🚀
